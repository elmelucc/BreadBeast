# BreadBeast
Winter Wonder Hack 2021 - Most Creative Award

The main goal of this prroject was to design a modified breadboard to help both beginners and electrical engineering pros.  In the next version (if that ever comes about), a focus would be placed on either beginners or pros to make a more refined end product.  

The BreadBeast is a standard breadboard with LEDs mounted beneath the connection holes.  The LEDs light up strips of holes on this prototype, but, with more time and resources, each hole would be connected to one LED.  The purpose of these lights is to make component placement easier for beginners and those with eyesight issues.  
The Breadbeast also holds a voltmeter in the form of an Arduino connected to a computer for this version.  The Arduino is programmed to read ground referenced voltages with a single ended probe, and send this data through the USB serial port.  A python GUI displays the voltage when activated.
